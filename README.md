# eloquent-js-exercises
This repo exists to hold all files that contain my solutions to the end of chapter exercises as I read through Eloquent Javascript by Martin Haverbeke.

Each directory is separated by chapter and contains the following: 
+ an authored TypeScript file (for fun).
+ a compiled JavaScript file.
+ the instructions in markdown for each end of chapter exercises.
+ any image assets.
