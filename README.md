# eloquent-js-exercises
This repo exists to hold all files that contain my solutions to the end of chapter exercises as I read through [Eloquent Javascript by Martin Haverbeke](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

Each chapter has it's own dedicated directory within the ```src``` folder.
All chapter folders will contain the following:
+ an authored TypeScript file (for fun).
+ a compiled Javascript file.
+ the end of chapter instructions in markdown.
+ any other assets (html,img,js).

This project also has a few dependencies used for setting up development within the browser. These can be installed by either:

```npm install```

or

```yarn install```
