# PROBLEM 1:

Write out a loop that makes seven calls to console.log
to output the following triangle

```

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

# PROBLEM 2:

Write a program that uses console.log to print all
the numbers from 1 to 100 with two exceptions. For
numbers divisible by 3 print 'Fizz' instead of the
number, and for numbers divisible bt 5 (and not 3),
print 'Buzz' instead.

Then, rewrite to print 'FizzBuzz' for numbers that
are divisible by both 3 and 5;


# PROBLEM 3:

Write a program that creates a string that represents
an 8 x 8 grid, using new line characters to separate
lines. At each position of the grid there is either a
space or a '#' character. The characters should form
a chess board. Passing this string to console.log
should show something like this:

# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #

**BONUS:**

When you have a program that generates this pattern,
define a variable size = 8 and change the program so
that it works for any size, outputting grid of the
given width and height.
